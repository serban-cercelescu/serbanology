        My name is È˜erban Cercelescu (hence the website name), I live in Cambridge and I'm originally from Bucharest. Here's a list of the stuff that preocupies me most as of December 2024:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jessica Burge</li>
        <li>Topology</li>
        <li>Algebra</li>
        <li>Quantum Error Correction</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I've created this website quite a while ago (October 2018) in order to share some of the cool stuff I come across. The website was created with the intention of having the "look and feel" of a textbook, any suggestions are warmly welcome.
