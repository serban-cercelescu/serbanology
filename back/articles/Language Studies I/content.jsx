    <h3>Foreword</h3>
    <p>
        Dear Jessica, <br/>
        this first part of what will be quite a long serries of letter themed articles on language. This first part only serves as the motivation for the
        following ones. Throughout this series, we'll explore topics such as the origin of language, language aquisition in children, the philosophical 
        "breakthroughs" of the past century, some neuroscience, programming languages and logic. The aim is to gain birdseye view on what is basically
        - the mechanism through which humans encode, store, communicate and process their knowledge about the world.

        On a more personal note, let me reveal something that I kept thinking of since I've met you: the language barrier. This winter holiday - when I got
        back home and told friends and family about you - very often I got a response on the lines of "relationships don't cross lanugage/cultural borders that well".
        Tamio also told me something quite personal: that his parents broke up because of that. I have to admit
        that they convinced me for a bid and made me question our future together, but then I decided that it's worth trying to make it work anyway. After a while,
        I considered that you learning Romanian would break that barrier - but you refused to do so. I held on to the belief that if you don't learn my language
        our relationship is ought to fail unless you overcome your foreign language anxiety - until I realised this: even if you do learn Romanian, the barrier
        will still be there. In fact, Tamio's parents spoke each other's languages. So here is the conclusion that I've arrived at:
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider the statements <$>A=\text{["We speak different native languages"]}</$>, <$>B=\text{["Communication errors will occur and build up"]}</$>,
        <$>C=\text{["We will end up accumulating a collection of significant communication errors"]}</$>, <$>D=\text{["We do not mitigate the occurence of communication errors"]}</$>
        <$>E=\text{["A breakdown in communication will occur"]}</$>. These are all statements which can be true or false.
        I consider the following to be true <i>beyond any reasonable doubt</i>: <$>A, A \implies B, (B \land D) \implies C, C \implies D</$>. Thus, in this model,
        <$>E</$> cannot be false, unless <$>D</$> is also false. So the question is, how can we ensure that <$>D</$> is false? My take is - if we both share our
        understanding of communication - i.e. if we think of language in the same way - i.e. if we reffer to language with the same terms.
    </p>
