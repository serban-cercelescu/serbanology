<h3>Foreword</h3>
<p>
    Hi there, dear reader. It's been almost two years since I've written anything here and to be honest, during those two years, I only kept this website running
    because somehow some of my articles became a quite popular resource in the competitive programming community, which despite the fact that I've left, is and probably
    always will be very close to my heart. In these two years, I have changed in so many ways that it would take a few books to enumerate the new perspectives I've
    gained and the opinions I have changed and why. However, perhaps the most valuable thing added to my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind">theory of mind</a>
    is a capacity to finally effectively put myself in other people's shoes and understand my limitations in doing so. Besides this newly acquired sense of empathy,
    I have also gained a new level of self-confidence when confronted with the reality of finally living on my own and being fully responsible for my own decisions.
    Thus, in a manner inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Aaronson">Scott Aaronson</a> and <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/">his blog</a>, I have decided to move beyond the insecurity that prevented me from writing more articles here and
    commit to owning and admitting my mistakes that might sneak into my writing. I am also going to publish some articles on my opinions (such as this one) because
    I know how desperately I needed to see a few new ones sometimes. All of this being said, here's my take on an issue that troubled me quite a lot throughout my teenage years.
</p>
<hr />

<p>
Ever since kindergarten, I have been absolutely obsessed with technical stuff. My interest started with engineering, by reading on random stuff such as how maglev trains and electric motors work, then moved on to physics because I felt a stronger grip on the laws that govern the mechanisms I envisioned could one day make me design something different and better than anyone before me. Roughly at that time, I discovered programming and algorithms through the Romanian Informatics Olympiad.
    Somehow, I ended up getting good at that, to the point where, as an 8th grader, I ended up ranking 5th amongst all Romanian students in my year group and 8th 
    amongst all middle-schoolers. By studying informatics, I eventually encountered concepts such as formal languages in my attempt to develop a better grip of the epistemology of my field of study and very powerful mathematical tools to aid me in designing better algorithms.
    Because I mostly trained on my own, I was forced to also learn some basics of phsychology, so I can gain some more awareness of my learning style.
    This is how I got to where I am now, working my way through a Maths&CS degree and studying behavioural science in parallel so I can be more aware the capabilities and limitations of the mind that drives my effort towards a better understanding the world around me.
    These few things are basically the central point of my life and activities revolve around now, and I have absolutely no regrets about that.
</p>
<p>
    However, as happy as I feel my life ended up being, this was not without hiccups, and one of the biggest hiccups was the feeling of rejection and being wrong for
    being so passionate about this stuff. At every stage of my development, there was always someone out there telling me something analogous to "no talking about
    maths during dinner". This took
    so many forms: classmates asking me why am I not dating my encyclopedia already when I was reading during the breaks between classes in primary school; kids telling
    me to surrender my bags to check for CS books on the way to summer camp "so I can learn how to have fun and be sociable"; friends telling me in high-school that
    "my problem" is that I only know how to talk about CS in high-school; relatives banning me from talking about physics problems with my uncle during dinner
    etc.
    All of this did not actually make me any less interested about these things, but it did make me feel "wrong" for wanting to share my passion about them. However, during
    lockdown, I finally got to discuss some more personal things with people close to me, and I understood a value that I feel the Romanian society I came from lacks, but
    desperately needs - tolerance. Thus, I have learnt how being more tolerant not only makes you a more pleasant presence aronud others, but also enables people to accept
    themsevles more and move past frustrations and dissatisfaction and how tolerance opens you to new ideas and perspectives you can benefit from. This is how I realised
    how "no maths during dinner" was not about me doing something wrong, but about the other's lack of willingess to understand my view of these things. This is how
    I realised that the way I should view these incidents should not be as reminders of my faults, but as I would a see scene out of some cliche movie where some jock
    bullies some nerds minding their own business for no aparent reason. The problem with the latter view however, is that there obviously is some reason behind the act.
</p>
<p>
    As much as I would want to just extend my middle finger towards the people showing this attitude towards "technical talk" in social contexts and think nothing more
    of them than assholes, it would go against most of my beliefs, as it isn't that hard to see what's the reasoning behind their actions. While I cannot say for sure,
    my intuition tells me that that reasoning is based on a great divergence in viewpoints. In these past two years, I have also learnt that for most people, Maths, CS,
    Physics and all these academic topics are more of a means to achieve a goal rather than the goal itself. I think it's pretty safe to say that even in the academic
    environment, people who see these better understanding of these topics as the end goal form a minority, and as with any minority there are things you cannot easily
    get unless you're part of it or in close contact to it. Things such as how it is to not be able to recall a single day in the past decade when you didn't do some reading,
    how it is to form the unbreakable habit of trying to crack problems in your head during your daily commute, or how it feels to know that you cannot share with your
    loved ones what you've done throughout the day, because you can only say "I've been doing some work" when in fact you boiled with interest and over some niche
    paper throughout the whole day. I have met many other people in this minority who live happy and full lives, surrounded by people outside it who accept them the way
    they are, people who can talk about the weather, the news, sports and the most recent gossip besides their interests. In the same way that some avid football
    fan should be allowed to talk about the latest game, or a gamer talk about their League of Legends achievements despite the fact there might be people around who don't
    give a single damn about it, a mathematician should be allowed to talk about his passion whenever he or she pleases. This is not to say one should be let to ramble
    about their thing in a monologue when no one wants to listen, but that if someone wants to listen, what they enjoy discussing is not to be judged by the ones around.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, to end this long time coming article:
</p>
<p>
    If you are some kid out there who is really passionate about something and the ones around tell you "no talking about maths during dinner", trust me that there are others
    out there waiting to be met who are just as passionate and willing to talk about it anytime as you are.
    Finally, if you are someone who found themselves saying "no talking about maths during dinner", please have the minimal understanding that there are people who feel
    the same when talking about a let's say physics problem, as you do when you're talking about what you like most.
