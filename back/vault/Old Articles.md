Back in highschool, I wrote a couple of tutorials that became quite popular in the competitive programming community. Here's a list of them:

* [[An Uberproblem]]
* [[The Trick From Aliens]]
* [[An Intuitive Approach To Taylor's Theorem]]
* [[A Bitwise Convolution Tutorial]]

Ngl, I am very proud of these, despite having outgrown their stlye \<3
